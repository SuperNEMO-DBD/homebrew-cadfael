# Contributing to Cadfael

[Cadfael](https://github.com/supernemo-dbd/homebrew-cadfael) is a [Homebrew](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew) tap of Formulae for installing
a software development kit for the SuperNEMO experiment.

To contribute a new formula or a new version of an existing formula, please submit your pull request here, though note these may be forwarded upstream to Linuxbrew/Homebrew if needed.

Patches to fix issues particular to Linux should not affect the behaviour of the formula on Mac. Use `if OS.mac?` and `if OS.linux?` as necessary to preserve the existing behaviour on Mac.
